College life indeed is the best phase of anyone\u2019s life, a wild mish-mash of experiences, with all sort of hilarious stuff going down in the hostels and campus. My 4 years in E.C.E was full of excitement and fun whether it be sitting through boring lectures , passing engineering papers to finding the papers I really had interest in. It was in my 4th semester that I realized I wanted to pursue electronics as my main and since then It had been a journey worth all my efforts. Yes, it feels good to be in the industry I wanted to work for. Currently I am an ASIC Engineer in CPU team at Nvidia. To all the people out there the only suggestion I would give is find what interests you and then pursue it with all your dedication,enjoying your journey along the way. Finding what interests you is the tough part , once that is done then it\u2019s all adherence and patience game for you. For any specifics you can always contact me.
