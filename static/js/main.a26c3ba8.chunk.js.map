The workshop was concluded with certificate of participation given to the attendees to boost their confidence.\"\r\n}];\r\n\r\nexport default eventDetails;\r\n","//jshint esversion:6\r\nimport React from \"react\";\r\nimport eventDetails from \"./EventDetails\";\r\nimport {Eventpic} from \"../Image\";\r\n\r\nfunction eventList(event,index){\r\n  const imgAddress=\"images/events/\"+event.src+\".jpg\";\r\n  return(\r\n    <div class=\"row\">\r\n      <div class=\"col-lg-5 col-md-10 events-pic\">\r\n      <br />\r\n        <Eventpic key={index} src={imgAddress} />\r\n      </div>\r\n      <div class=\"col-lg-7 col-md-10\">\r\n        <br />\r\n        <h3>Participants: {event.Participants}</h3>\r\n        <h3>Description :</h3>\r\n        <h5><em>{event.Description}</em></h5>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <hr />\r\n      <br />\r\n    </div>\r\n  )\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction Events(){\r\n  return (\r\n    eventDetails.map(eventList)\r\n)}\r\n\r\nexport default Events\r\n","//jshint esversion:6\r\nimport React from \"react\";\r\n\r\nfunction WhatWeDo(){\r\n  return (\r\n    <p className=\"about-content\">\r\n    <strong>What We do</strong>\r\n    <ul class=\"what-we-do\">\r\n      <li>We conduct various workshops on both core and non-core topics, including analog electronics, computer vision etc.\r\n      </li>\r\n      <li>\r\n        We organize various online quizzes with prizes for the best performers.\r\n      </li>\r\n      <li>We release online content on various subjects based on trending topics which are informative and useful.\r\n      </li>\r\n      <li>We also conduct counselling sessions where we discuss about various career options after college.\r\n      </li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n  </p>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default WhatWeDo;\r\n","//jshint esversion:6\r\nimport React from \"react\";\r\nimport WhatWeDo from \"./What-we-do\";\r\n\r\nfunction About(){\r\n  return (\r\n    <p className=\"what-we-do\">\r\n      ECE Society BIT Mesra aims to provide a platform where electronics enthusiasts can come together and learn this vast and interesting subject.
